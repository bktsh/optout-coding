#Find Ranges  
Write a function that takes an array of ints and returns a set of ranges denoting the increasing ranges.  Please code in Java. Example:
* input:[1,2,3,4,5,6,3,6,8,5,8,9,4,3,5] 
* output: (0,5)(6,8)(9,11)(13,14)

#Drawing App 
OO Design - Pick One (Looking for what classes you would use and what would their interactions be at a high level)
1. Design a Deck of cards. (This might be part of a poker game or something)
2. Design a Drawing application (think MS Paint, BONUS: what about Undo functionality).Name a design pattern you know or have used & tell me about it. (Java certification, Gang of Four)

#Algorithm Design 
Pick One (Asking essentially for dictated pseudo-code and approach to solving problem)  
1. Write a method that counts the number of words in a string.    
2. Write a method that reverses the order of words in a string without reversing the order of the letters within the word. (example: “a quick brown fox” becomes “fox brown quick a”.)
